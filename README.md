## How to Build

Before building the solution you will need to copy your `Sitecore.Kernel.dll` from your project into the `Library` folder. This is not included in source control for licensing reasons.

The project builds against .NET 4 to allow compatability with the widest range of Sitecore versions, because of this, the `Sitecore.Kernel.dll` you use must be version 6.x or below, as Sitecore 7.x is built against .NET 4.5.
